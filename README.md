# Hash

This is just a little Java program I wrote based off of some information I found
across the internet while I was looking for ways to hash a file (because Ruby was
being really slow with that). 

This basically just lets you pass a file and a number selecting which algorithm
you'd like to use to hash it. It then prints the hash to console, for you to
do whatever you'd like with it, whether that's passing it back into your 
(slower) Ruby application or just looking at the beauty of file hashing.

The arguments are documented in the source code. If you'd like to contribute
your own port of this to another language, feel free to make a pull request.
